    "\n",
    "**Vectorization describes the absence of any explicit looping, indexing, etc., in the code - these things are taking place, of course, just “behind the scenes” in optimized, pre-compiled C code. Vectorized code has many advantages, among which are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. vectorized code is more concise and easier to read\n",
    "2. fewer lines of code generally means fewer bugs\n",
    "3. the code more closely resembles standard mathematical notation (making it easier, typically, to correctly code mathematical constructs)\n",
    "4. vectorization results in more “Pythonic” code. Without vectorization, our code would be littered with inefficient and difficult to read for loops. </p>\n",

Subject to certain constraints, **the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes.** Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that **looping occurs in C instead of Python.** It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation.\n",
