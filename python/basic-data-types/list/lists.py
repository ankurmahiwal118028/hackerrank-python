"""
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data,
  the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
